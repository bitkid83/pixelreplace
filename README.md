# pixelreplace
Loads an image file using SDL Image, replaces pixels of the same color selected by the mouse.
Not really a useful program. I simply made it to learn about image data in code.

Requires SDL2 and SDL2_image to build.
Visual Studio 2013 Solution file included but will build with anything.
